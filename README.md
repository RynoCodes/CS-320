    How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
      I can ensure my code, program or software is funcional and secure by testing the program early and often. Using automated testing I can ensure the code meets the client requirements and is secure against external attacks. 
    How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
      I interperate user needs by reading the requirements carefully and fully, and reffering back to them often. 
    How do I approach designing software?
      I approach designing software as if it were a puzzle. By using the user needs as a blueprint and carefully construcing the program to meet their needs.
